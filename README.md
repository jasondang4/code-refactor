## Horiseon Code refractor

## Description

This first week challenge assignment was a code refractor. In which I was tasked with taking an existing website and code, and then sifting throgh the code making it follow modern semantic tags, more streamlined, and meet accessibility standards. Furthermore I went through the css and cleared up redundencies in the coding.
